### Ongoing Projects
- [Team Project - TibaArt | Vue SPA Web Application] (https://tibamef2e.com/tjd101/g2/front)<br>
  A full-featured single-page application presents an online art exhibition platform, built with Vue 3, Pinia, and PHP/MySQL. It supports user authentication, a member center, expo browsing, donation functionality, and a dynamic shopping cart. The front end is fully modularized and powered by Vue Router and Fetch API.

#### üîß My Contributions:
- Designed and implemented the **navigation bar** with responsive behavior and active route highlighting using Vue Router.
- Developed the **homepage**, integrating GSAP-powered scroll animations and structured sections that guide users through the platform‚Äôs mission and features, including an interactive art-themed quiz.
- Built the **member center**, handling user authentication, dynamic rendering of member data, artist exposition status, and donation history ‚Äî all via seamless API integration with the backend.
